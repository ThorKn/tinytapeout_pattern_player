# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.

# This will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  title:        "8x8 Bit Pattern Player"      # Project title
  description:  "8x8 bit serial programmable, addressable and playable memory."      # Short description of what your project does
  how_it_works: "The 8x8 memory is a 64-bit shiftregister, consisting of 64 serial chained D-FlipFlops (data: IN0, clk_sr: IN1). 8 memoryslots of each 8 bit can be directly addressed via addresslines (3 bit: IN2, IN3, IN4) or from a clockdriven player (3 bit counter, clk_pl: IN7). A mode selector line (mode: IN5) sets the operation mode to addressing or to player. The 8 outputs are driven by the 8 bit of the addressed memoryslot."      # Longer description of how the project works
  how_to_test:  "Programm the memory: Start by filling the 64 bit shiftregister via data and clk_sr, each rising edge on clk_sr shifts a new data bit into the register. Select mode: Set mode input for direct addressing or clockdriven player. Address mode: Address a memoryslot via the three addresslines and watch the memoryslot at the outputs. Player mode: Each rising edge at clk_pl enables the next memoryslot to the outputs."      # Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  external_hw:  "You could programm, address and play the 8x8 Bit Pattern Player with a breadboard, two clock buttons and some dipswitches on the input side. Add some LED to the output side. Just like the WOKWI simulation."      # Describe any external hardware needed
